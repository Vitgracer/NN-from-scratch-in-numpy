# Deep Learning from Scratch (with Pure NumPy, hey)

Welcome to the neural jungle!  
This repo is a beginner deep dive into popular deep learning techniques — built from the ground up using **pure NumPy**. No PyTorch. No TensorFlow. Just you, math, and `np.dot()`.

## What's Inside?

- ✅ Logistic Regression  
  - Forward + Backward Prop  
  - Gradient Descent  
- 🧠 Neural Network with 1 Hidden Layer  
- 🏗️ Neural Network with N Hidden Layers (a.k.a. Deep Stuff™)  
- 🔁 Manual Backpropagation (yes, we took the chain rule personally)

## Why?

Because using PyTorch is fun.  
But *implementing* PyTorch (sort of) in NumPy?  
**Big brain energy.**
